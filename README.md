## Abstract
<!-- Ty: for SE normalization, confirming that no change needs to be made to SE for max normalization (essentially just sliding x-axis scale... I don't see why SE would change here), but for fig4 WT/no stall normalization, SE should be also divided (minused, log) by mean_ratio[status="no stall"] because the x-axis isn't slid equally for each data point (kozak, stem loop, or drug +/-); this blows up the SE so making sure that is right... -->

Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are present in over half of all human mRNAs.
uORFs can potently regulate the translation of downstream open reading frames by several mechanisms: siphoning of scanning ribosomes, regulating re-initiation, and allowing interactions between scanning and elongating ribosomes.
However, the consequences of these different mechanisms for the regulation of protein expression remain incompletely understood.
Here, we performed systematic measurements on the uORF-containing 5′ UTR of the cytomegaloviral *UL4* mRNA to test alternative models of uORF-mediated regulation in human cells.
We find that a terminal diproline-dependent elongating ribosome stall in the *UL4* uORF prevents decreases in main ORF translation when ribosome loading onto the mRNA is reduced.
This uORF-mediated buffering is insensitive to the location of the ribosome stall along the uORF.
Computational kinetic modeling based on our measurements suggests that scanning ribosomes dissociate rather than queue when they collide with stalled elongating ribosomes within the *UL4* uORF.
We identify several human uORFs that repress main ORF translation via a similar terminal diproline motif.
We propose that ribosome stalls in uORFs provide a general mechanism for buffering against reductions in main ORF translation during stress and developmental transitions.
